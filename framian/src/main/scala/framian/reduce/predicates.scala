/** A [[Reducer]] that exististentially quantifies a predicate
  * as a reduction over a collection of [[Cell]]s.
  *
  * This reducer will return true upon encountering the first value
  * that is available and meaningful ''and'' applying the predicate
  * `p` to that value returns true. Otherwise, returns false.
  *
  * This reducer is unusual in that it will ignore [[NonValue]]s, in
  * particular, it will not propogate [[NM]]. If the predicate can be
  * satisfied by a value that is available and meaningful elsewhere in
  * the collection, then this reduction should still return true.
  *
  * This reducer will only traverse the entire collection if it never
  * encounters an available and meaningful value that satisfies the
  * predicate `p`.
  *
  * @example {{{
  * Series.empty[Int, Int].reduce(new Exists[Int](i => true)) == Value(false)
  *
  * Series(1 -> 1, 2 -> 2).reduce(new Exists[Int](i => i < 2)) == Value(true)
  *
  * Series.fromCells[Int, Int](1 -> NA, 2 -> 1).reduce(new Exists[Int](i => i < 2)) == Value(true)
  * Series.fromCells[Int, Int](1 -> NM, 2 -> 1).reduce(new Exists[Int](i => i < 2)) == Value(true)
  * }}}
  *
  * @note This reducer will always return precisely `Value[Boolean]`,
  *   rather than `Cell[Boolean]`. This in constrast to most reducers
  *   that will also return [[NonValue]]s.
  *
  * @tparam  A  the value type of the column to reduce.
  *
  * @constructor Create a existential quantifier reducer from a predicate `p`.
  * @param  p  the predicate to apply to the values of the column.
  * @see [[ForAll]]
